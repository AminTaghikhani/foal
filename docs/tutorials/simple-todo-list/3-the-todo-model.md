# The Todo Model

Let's create your first model. The CLI provides a useful command to generate a new file with an empty model.

```bash
foal generate entity todo
```

> FoalTS uses [TypeORM](http://typeorm.io), a complete *Object-Relational Mapper*, to communicate with the database(s). In TypeORM, simple models are called *entities* and are classes decorated with the `Entity` decorator.


> Every new project in FoalTS uses an `SQLite` database as it does not require any additional installation. But TypeORM supports many other databases. We will keep this one in this tutorial for simplicity.

Open the file `todo.entity.ts` in the `src/app/entities` directory and add a `text` column.

```typescript
import { Column, Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class Todo {

  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  text: string;

}

```

When running the app, this class will generate a new table in the `db.sqlite3` database.

```
+------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+
|                             todo                             |
+------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+
| id         | integer   | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL |
| text       | varchar   |                                     |
+------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+
```

> Database schema is auto created from the entities definition on every application launch. This behavior is useful during debug and development but is not suitable for a production environment (you could lose production data). Please refer to the [migrations section](../../databases/generate-and-run-migrations.md) to manually update a database schema.
