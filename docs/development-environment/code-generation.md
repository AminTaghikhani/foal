# Code Generation

## Create a project

```bash
foal createapp my-app
```

Create a new directory with all the required files to get started.

If you specify the flag `--mongodb`, the new project will use `mongoose` and `@foal/mongoose` in place of `typeorm` and `@foal/typeorm`. You can find more information [here](../databases/using-mongoose.md).

If you specify the flag `--yaml`, the new project will use YAML format for its configuration files. You can find more information [here](../deployment-and-environments/configuration.md).

## Create a controller

```bash
foal g controller <name>
```

Create a new controller in `./src/app/controllers`, in `./controllers` or in the current directory depending on which folders are found.

If you are in the root directory and you want to automatically register the controller within the app controller you can add the `--register` flag.

```bash
foal g controller <name> --register
```

## Create an entity (simple model)

```bash
foal g entity <name>
```

Create a new entity in `./src/app/entities`, in `./entities` or in the current directory depending on which folders are found.

## Create a model (only for Mongoose)

```bash
foal g model <name>
```

Create a new model in `./src/app/models`, in `./models` or in the current directory depending on which folders are found.

## Create REST API

```bash
foal g rest-api <name>
```

Create a new controller and a new entity to build a basic REST API. Depending on which directories are found, they will be generated in `src/app/{entities}|{controllers}/`, `{entities}|{controllers}/` or in the current directory.

If you are in the root directory and you want to automatically register the controller within the app controller you can add the `--register` flag.

```bash
foal g rest-api <name> --register
```

See the page [REST Blueprints](../api-section/rest-blueprints.md) for more details.

## Create a hook

```bash
foal g hook <name>
```

Create a new hook in `./src/app/hooks`, in `./hooks` or in the current directory depending on which folders are found.

## Create a script

```bash
foal g script <name>
```

Create a new shell script in `src/scripts` regardless of where you run the command.


## Create a sub-app

```bash
foal g sub-app <name>
```

Create a new sub-app with all its files in `./src/app/sub-apps`, in `./sub-apps` or in the current directory depending on which folders are found.

## Create a service

```bash
foal g service <name>
```

Create a new service in `./src/app/services`, in `./services` or in the current directory depending on which folders are found.
