- [Report a bug](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/issues/new)
- [Suggest a new feature](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/issues/new)
- [Other (ask a question, etc)](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/issues/new)

## Submit a PR

If the PR is about code (not documentation), please submit an issue first to discuss on this.

### Set up the development/test environment

1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
2. Install [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) by running `npm i -g lerna`
3. Start the dev/test environment by running `npm run start-docker` (to stop use `npm run stop-docker`)

### Install dependencies

Run `lerna bootstrap`.

### Run tests and linting

Run `lerna run test` and `npm run lint` from the root directory.

You can also run the tests of only one package by going to its directory and running `npm run test` or `npm run dev:test` (watch mode).

### General guidelines

- All new code should have tests.
- Use linting rules.

## Security

To report a security issue please email directly loic.poullain@centraliens.net.

## Project Structure

The FoalTS project consists of several packages. The publication and dependency management is handled by [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.

### `@foal/cli` Package Structure

```bash
generate # Handles the commands `foal createapp` and `foal generate`
  |- generators # Contains the code which renders the templates or updates the files
  |- mocks # Contains some pieces of code used to test the file "updaters"
  |- specs # Defines how the generated files should look like in different scenarios (specifications)
  |- templates # Contains the actual templates used to generate the files
  '- utils # Contains some helpers shared by all the generators
```

Usually components that do not rely on a third-party library are located in the `@foal/core` package.

## Conventions

### Import declarations

Import declarations should be organized in three distinct blocks depending on if they refer to the standard library, a 3P package or a FoalTS component.

Example:
```typescript
// std
import { strictEqual } from 'assert';

// 3p
import { Column } from 'typeorm';

// FoalTS
import { something } from '../somewhere';
```
